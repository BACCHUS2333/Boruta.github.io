# Boruta Feature Selection

Welcome to the Boruta Feature Selection repository! This project focuses on implementing Boruta, a feature selection algorithm, to identify relevant features in a dataset. Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning practitioner, or someone interested in feature selection, this code provides insights into leveraging Boruta for effective model building.

## Features

- **Boruta Algorithm:** Implement the Boruta algorithm for feature selection, helping to identify significant features in the dataset.

- **Random Forest Classifier:** Utilize a Random Forest classifier as the base model for Boruta, providing a robust foundation for feature importance evaluation.

- **Visualization:** Visualize the results of Boruta to interpret feature importance and selection outcomes.
